"""tools — the tool registry core module.

Bridges the existing dispatch surface onto the kernel Context: every
core tool becomes ctx-callable during boot. Pack tools are NOT bridged —
converted packs are self-contained and register their own tools; when
no pack modules actually booted, the bridge falls back to everything,
keeping behavior identical for pack-less boots.
