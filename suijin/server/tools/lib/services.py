"""Service seam — the proto-Context (Phase 0, item 5).

Tool modules must never import suijin.core upward (the recon found 8 such
inversions: battle/housekeeping -> blue scorer, run_commands -> red
session_control, providers -> red config_loader). Instead, core registers
its capabilities here at runtime-init, and tools import ONLY this seam.

This is deliberately tiny: in Phase 1 it becomes kernel Context.services.
Contract:
  - register(name, producer): producer is a ZERO-ARG callable invoked at
    get() time — registration never executes anything (no import side
    effects, no cycles)
  - get(name) -> value or None (missing services are the caller's problem
    to degrade gracefully)
  - has(name) / producer(name) for introspection and tests

Stdlib only. Thread-safe.
