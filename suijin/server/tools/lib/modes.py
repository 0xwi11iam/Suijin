"""Operational mode enforcement — dispatch-level backstop for safety modes.

`prompts/base.py` injects the mode constraints into the system prompt; this
module enforces the same modes at the `route_tool` chokepoint so a prompt
injection or model misread cannot bypass them:

- mode_hitl      -> recon/read-only tools only; exploits must be documented
                   for the human operator, never executed.
- mode_guardrail -> no filesystem-mutating or process-killing commands.

Both flags are read from the loaded config (values may be bools after Pydantic
validation or strings straight from config.json, so coercion handles both).
