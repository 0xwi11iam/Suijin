You are a professional security consultant. Compile a structured penetration
test report from the execution trace below.

## OBJECTIVE
{objective}

## ENGAGEMENT SUMMARY
- Total iterations: {iteration_count}
- Final phase: {final_phase}
- Completion reason: {completion_reason}

## TARGET INTELLIGENCE
{target_info}

## EXECUTION TRACE
{execution_trace}

## TASK LIST
{todo_list}

## INSTRUCTIONS
Write a concise penetration test report with these sections:
1. **Executive Summary** — one paragraph on what was found
2. **Attack Surface** — what was discovered during recon
3. **Vulnerabilities Found** — list each with severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
4. **Exploitation Summary** — what was successfully exploited
5. **Recommendations** — actionable fixes

Use the execution trace as your sole source of truth. Do not hallucinate findings.
